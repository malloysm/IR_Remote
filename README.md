# IR_Remote
Using an Arduino, some pushbuttons, and an IR LED (IR1503) a remote control was created for ECE 387. 
IRremote.h library and code from http://www.righto.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html

The example 'IRrecvDump.ino' included in the library was used with a 38kHz IR receiver (TSSP58038) to determine the protocol and codes generated by the Vizio remote for the power, volume up, volume down, and channel up buttons.

Then, the example 'IRsendDemo.ino' was modified to send the codes when the respective pushbutton was pressed.
